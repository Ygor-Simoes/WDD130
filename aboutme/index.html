    <h2>Ygor Simoes</h2>
    <h3>My name is Ygor, I`m Brazilian and I arrived in the US a couple of weeks ago. I toke an introductory coding class in Pathway Connect and that is why I decided to take a major in computer science. I also served my mission in Praia, Cape Verde. During my mission, I had the opportunity to learn English, and this is when I decided to come to BYU. My favorite activities are playing soccer, volleyball, and riding my bike. In other words, I just like to be outside.    </h3>
